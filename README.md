# Form AI

FormAI is an android application designed to determine the correctness of a user's workout form and correct it. Through the use of Google's ML Kit Vision Pose Detection API machine learning allows for tracking of the user's joints as nodes in order to calculate depth and angles for exercise accuracy and safety.

## Inspiration
As avid gym enthusiasts, the recent COVID-19 lockdowns have taken a significant toll on our fitness regimens. As a means to stay active, we tried building home gyms and incorporate workouts that can be done at home. The problem that still remained was the lack of gym partners that could check our form to ensure we were doing exercises right

## What it does
Form AI uses pose detection to determine if you are using proper form while exercising. For example, it can determine if your squat form is correct or not, just by turning on your camera!

## How we built it
Form AI was built using Android, Java, and Google's ML pose detection library. To determine the correct form, the angles between different nodes that were detected by the pose detection library were calculated. We chose to build an Android app with the logic written in Java as most people use their phones while they are working out.

## Challenges we ran into
For many of the members on our team, it was their first time developing an app with Android. So a lot of time was spent learning the basics of an Android app and trying to build a functional UI.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Having very little prior experience with Android, we are very happy with how our app turned out. It was also a challenge to use the pose detection library as we spent countless hours trying to get it to work and determining how it would determine if the form is correct or not.
